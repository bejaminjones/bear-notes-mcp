# Bear MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Claude with direct access to your Bear notes database, enabling comprehensive note management beyond Bear's standard API limitations.

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

This tool directly accesses Bear's database. While comprehensive safety measures are implemented:
- Always maintain regular Bear backups
- Test with database copies when experimenting  
- The tool is not affiliated with Bear's developers
- Use at your own risk for production databases

  


## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Bear app installed on macOS
- Claude Desktop app
- Node.js 18+ installed

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bear-notes-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

2. **Add to Claude Desktop configuration:**
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bear": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/bear-notes-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Start using:**
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Ask Claude: "What Bear notes do I have?"
- Begin managing your notes with natural language!

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### Database Location
The server automatically finds your Bear database at:
```
~/Library/Group Containers/9K33E3U3T4.net.shinyfrog.bear/Application Data/database.sqlite
```

### Backup Location
Automatic backups are stored at:
```
~/Documents/Bear MCP Backups/
```

### Environment Variables
- `BEAR_DB_PATH`: Override default database location
- `BEAR_BACKUP_DIR`: Override default backup directory
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'development' for debug logging

## 📚 **Usage Examples**

### Basic Note Management
```
"Show me my recent notes"
"Find all notes tagged with 'project'"  
"Create a new note about today's meeting"
"Search for notes containing 'API documentation'"
```

### Advanced Operations
```
"Analyze my note-taking patterns this month"
"Find notes similar to my current project"
"Show me notes with attachments"
"What are my most-used tags?"
```

### Organization & Cleanup
```
"Archive old notes from last year"
"Find duplicate or similar notes"
"Show me notes that might need better tags"
"Create a backup of my current database"
```

## 🛡️ **Safety & Best Practices**

### ⚠️ **Critical Safety Rules**
1. **Always quit Bear before write operations** - The server detects and prevents this
2. **Backups are automatic** - Every write creates a timestamped backup
3. **Test with copies first** - Use database copies for experimentation
4. **Keep Bear updated** - Ensure schema compatibility

### 💡 **Best Practices**
- Use read operations freely - they're completely safe
- Let the server handle tag creation automatically
- Use specific search terms for better results
- Archive notes instead of deleting when possible

### 🏷️ **Tag Formatting Guidelines**

**✅ RECOMMENDED TAG FORMATS:**
- Simple tags: `work`, `personal`, `urgent`, `meeting`
- Nested categories: `work/projects`, `personal/health`, `study/math`
- Time-based: `2024`, `january`, `q1`
- Project codes: `proj001`, `alpha`, `beta`

**❌ AVOID THESE FORMATS (auto-corrected):**
- **Hyphens**: `project-alpha` → becomes `projectalpha`
- **Spaces**: `work meeting` → becomes `workmeeting`  
- **Underscores**: `tag_name` → becomes `tagname`
- **Mixed case**: `ProjectAlpha` → becomes `projectalpha`

**🔧 Automatic Tag Sanitization:**
The server automatically validates and sanitizes all tags:
- **Lowercase only**: `Project` → `project`
- **No spaces**: `tag name` → `tagname`
- **No underscores**: `tag_name` → `tagname`
- **No hyphens**: `project-alpha` → `projectalpha`
- **No commas**: `tag,name` → `tagname`
- **✅ Forward slashes preserved**: `project/alpha` → `project/alpha` (for nested tags)

**Tag warnings** are returned when tags are modified, so you'll know exactly what changes were made.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**"Bear is currently running" error:**
- Quit Bear completely before write operations
- Check Activity Monitor for Bear processes

**"Database not found" error:**
- Verify Bear is installed and has been opened at least once
- Check database path: `~/Library/Group Containers/9K33E3U3T4.net.shinyfrog.bear/Application Data/`

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Ensure Claude Desktop has necessary file system permissions
- Check that the database file is readable

**Slow performance:**
- Large databases (10,000+ notes) may take longer
- Use specific search terms instead of broad queries
- Consider using pagination with `limit` parameters

### Getting Help
1. Check the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md)
2. Review [common usage patterns](docs/examples.md)  
3. Enable debug logging with `NODE_ENV=development`
4. Check backup directory for automatic backups

## 📈 **Performance**

- **Typical response time**: Under 2 seconds for most operations
- **Large databases**: Tested with 10,000+ notes
- **Memory usage**: ~50MB typical, ~100MB for complex operations
- **Concurrent operations**: Read operations can run simultaneously
- **Write operations**: Queued for safety
