# Usage Examples

Practical examples and workflows for the Bear MCP Server.

## üéØ Common Workflows

### Getting Started - Basic Operations

#### Explore Your Bear Database
```
"What's in my Bear database?"
"Show me my database statistics"
"How many notes do I have?"
```

#### Browse Your Notes
```
"Show me my recent notes"
"List my 10 most recent notes"
"What notes do I have tagged with 'work'?"
"Find notes containing 'project' in the title"
```

#### Explore Your Tags
```
"What tags do I use most?"
"Show me all my Bear tags"
"How many notes are tagged with 'personal'?"
```

### Content Discovery and Search

#### Basic Search
```
"Search for notes about 'machine learning'"
"Find notes containing 'API documentation'"
"Show me notes with 'meeting' in the title"
```

#### Advanced Search
```
"Find notes tagged 'work' but not 'archived', created after January 1st"
"Search for notes containing 'JavaScript' with fuzzy matching"
"Find notes longer than 1000 characters tagged with 'research'"
```

#### Content Analysis
```
"Find notes similar to this content: 'React hooks and state management'"
"What notes are related to note ID 123?"
"Analyze my note-taking patterns this month"
```

### Organization and Management

#### Create and Edit Notes
```
"Create a new note titled 'Daily Standup' with tags 'work' and 'meetings'"
"Update note 123 to add 'urgent' tag"
"Duplicate my 'Template' note with suffix ' - New Project'"
```

#### Tag Management and Validation
```
"Create a note with tags 'Project-Alpha' and 'work meeting'"
# Result: Tags become 'projectalpha' and 'workmeeting' with warnings

"Add tags 'project/frontend' and 'JavaScript_React' to note 456"
# Result: 'project/frontend' stays, 'JavaScript_React' becomes 'javascriptreact'

"Create a note with nested tags 'work/projects/2024' and 'personal/health'"
# Result: Both tags preserved as nested tags work with forward slashes
```

#### Archive and Organize
```
"Archive note 456"
"Find old notes I should archive"
"Show me notes with attachments"
```

```

## üè∑Ô∏è Tag Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Recommended Tag Formats
- **Simple tags**: `work`, `personal`, `urgent`
- **Nested categories**: `work/projects/alpha`, `personal/health/fitness`
- **Time-based**: `2024`, `q1`, `january`
- **Status indicators**: `todo`, `inprogress`, `completed`
- **Project codes**: `proj001`, `alpha`, `beta`

### ‚ùå Tags to Avoid (Auto-Sanitized)
- **With hyphens**: `project-alpha` ‚Üí becomes `projectalpha`
- **With spaces**: `work meeting` ‚Üí becomes `workmeeting`
- **With underscores**: `project_alpha` ‚Üí becomes `projectalpha`
- **Mixed case**: `ProjectAlpha` ‚Üí becomes `projectalpha`
- **With commas**: `work,urgent` ‚Üí becomes `workurgent`

### üí° Pro Tips
- Use forward slashes for hierarchy: `work/projects/2024/alpha`
- Keep tags short and memorable
- Be consistent with naming conventions
- Use nested tags for better organization
- Let the server handle tag validation automatically

#### Step 3: Content Verification
```
"Verify database integrity and health"
"Check for any corrupted or problematic notes"
"Ensure all tags and relationships are intact"
```

## üîß Advanced Use Cases

### Automated Content Analysis

#### Writing Pattern Analysis
```
"Analyze my writing patterns and productivity trends"
"What times of day do I create most notes?"
"How has my note-taking evolved over time?"
```

#### Content Quality Assessment
```
"Find notes that might need more detail or structure"
"Identify notes with poor formatting or organization"
"Show me notes that could benefit from better tags"
```

#### Knowledge Gap Identification
```
"Find topics I've started but not completed"
"Identify areas where I have sparse documentation"
"Show me potential connections between isolated notes"
```

### Bulk Operations and Maintenance

#### Bulk Tag Management
```
"Find all notes tagged 'old-project' and update them to 'archived-project'"
"Add 'needs-review' tag to all notes older than 1 year"
"Standardize tag naming conventions across all notes"
```

#### Content Maintenance
```
"Find notes with outdated information or broken links"
"Identify notes that reference deprecated tools or methods"
"Update project status across multiple related notes"
```

#### Archive Management
```
"Archive all completed project notes from 2023"
"Find notes that should be archived based on age and usage"
"Create archive summaries for major projects"
```

## üí° Pro Tips and Best Practices

### Efficient Searching

#### Use Specific Terms
```
‚úÖ Good: "Find notes about 'React hooks useState'"
‚ùå Avoid: "Find notes about programming"
```

#### Combine Multiple Criteria
```
‚úÖ Good: "Find notes tagged 'work' created after January 1st with 'API' in title"
‚ùå Avoid: Multiple separate queries
```

#### Use Pagination for Large Results
```
‚úÖ Good: "Show me first 20 notes tagged 'research', then next 20"
‚ùå Avoid: Requesting all results at once for large datasets
```

### Effective Organization

#### Consistent Tagging Strategy
```
‚úÖ Good: Use hierarchical tags like 'project/web-app', 'meeting/weekly'
‚ùå Avoid: Inconsistent tag naming like 'proj', 'project', 'projects'
```

#### Descriptive Titles
```
‚úÖ Good: "Weekly Team Meeting - Feb 18, 2024"
‚ùå Avoid: "Meeting", "Notes", "Untitled"
```

#### Regular Maintenance
```
‚úÖ Good: Monthly cleanup and organization sessions
‚ùå Avoid: Letting organization problems accumulate
```

### Safety and Reliability

#### Test Before Bulk Operations
```
‚úÖ Good: Test write operations on a few notes first
‚ùå Avoid: Running bulk operations without testing
```

#### Use Read Operations Freely
```
‚úÖ Good: Explore and analyze with read operations
‚ùå Avoid: Being hesitant to use analysis tools
```

#### Keep Bear Updated
```
‚úÖ Good: Regular Bear app updates for schema compatibility
‚ùå Avoid: Using outdated Bear versions
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Issue: Too Many Results
**Problem**: Queries returning thousands of results
**Solution**: Use pagination and more specific criteria
```
Instead of: "Show me all my notes"
Try: "Show me my 20 most recent notes" or "Find notes tagged 'current-project'"
```

### Issue: Bear Process Running
**Problem**: Write operations blocked by running Bear
**Solution**: Quit Bear completely before write operations
```
1. Quit Bear app completely
2. Check Activity Monitor for Bear processes
3. Then perform write operations
```

### Issue: Unclear Search Results
**Problem**: Getting unexpected or irrelevant results
**Solution**: Use more specific search terms and filters
```
Instead of: "Find notes about work"
Try: "Find notes tagged 'work' containing 'project status' created this month"
```

### Issue: Performance Slowdown
**Problem**: Slow responses with large databases
**Solution**: Use pagination and specific filters
```
Instead of: Broad searches on large databases
Try: Use date ranges, tag filters, and limit parameters
```
