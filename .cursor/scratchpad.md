# Bear SQLite MCP Server Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal:** Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude to interface directly with Bear's SQLite database, providing comprehensive note management capabilities beyond the limitations of Bear's x-callback-url API.

**Key Motivations:**
- Bear's API is limited to Apple platforms and x-callback-url protocol
- Direct SQLite access enables cross-platform functionality
- MCP provides standardized interface for AI model integration
- Full CRUD operations on notes, tags, and metadata
- Advanced search and analysis capabilities not available through Bear's API

**Technical Foundation:**
- Existing Bear database located at: `~/Library/Group Containers/9K33E3U3T4.net.shinyfrog.bear/Application Data/database.sqlite`
- Database contains tables: ZSFNOTE, ZSFTAG, ZSFNOTETAG, ZSFNOTESEARCH, ZSFNOTEFILE
- Safety protocols documented for backup and transaction management
- Read-only exploration and write operations patterns established

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Database Safety:** Bear must be closed during write operations to prevent corruption
2. **Schema Complexity:** Bear uses Core Data with Z-prefixed tables and complex relationships
3. **Data Integrity:** Maintaining referential integrity across note-tag relationships
4. **Backup Management:** Implementing reliable backup/restore mechanisms
5. **MCP Protocol:** Implementing proper MCP server specification compliance

**Security Considerations:**
- Encrypted notes remain inaccessible (by design)
- Platform-specific database paths and permissions
- Transaction safety and rollback capabilities
- Proper error handling for locked database states

**Integration Complexity:**
- Core Data timestamp formats and primary key management
- Tag hierarchy and relationship maintenance
- File attachment handling and path management
- Search index synchronization

6. **`find_duplicate_tags`** - Identify similar tags for consolidation
7. **`cleanup_orphaned_tags`** - Remove unused tags
8. **`standardize_tag_names`** - Fix tag naming inconsistencies

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- **Tag Standardization**: "Rename all 'proj' tags to 'project'"
- **Bulk Organization**: "Add 'archived' tag to all notes older than 2 years"
- **Cleanup Operations**: "Remove tags that are only used on 1-2 notes"
- **Hierarchy Restructuring**: "Move all 'work/meetings' tags under 'business'"
- **Duplicate Resolution**: "Merge 'JavaScript' and 'javascript' tags"
- **Mass Categorization**: "Add 'review-needed' to all notes without tags"

**Success Criteria:**
- Handle 1000+ tag operations in under 30 seconds
- Zero data loss during bulk operations
- Comprehensive conflict resolution and user feedback
- Full rollback capability for all operations
- Clear progress reporting for long-running tasks

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - This addresses a major pain point for users with extensive tag collections and would significantly improve the user experience for organization tasks.

**Expected Impact:** 
- Server will grow from 30 to 38 MCP tools
- Major productivity boost for users with large tag collections
- Enables sophisticated tag organization workflows
- Reduces manual tag management effort by 80-90%

## 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH: HASHTAG PARSING WORKAROUNDS IMPLEMENTED!

### ✅ WORKAROUND SUCCESS SUMMARY

**Problem Solved:** Bear's sidebar wasn't displaying hashtags from programmatically created notes.

**Root Cause:** Bear only parses hashtags when notes are created/edited through Bear's interface, not via direct database manipulation.

### 💡 SOLUTION: Comprehensive Workaround System

#### 🚀 **Primary Solution: Bear x-callback-url API Integration**
- **Method:** Use Bear's native `x-callback-url` API instead of direct database writes
- **Key Parameters:** `edit=yes` parameter triggers Bear's hashtag parsing
- **Format:** `bear://x-callback-url/create?title=...&text=...&tags=...&edit=yes`
- **Result:** ✅ **WORKS PERFECTLY** - hashtags appear in sidebar immediately!

#### 🛠️ **Technical Implementation:**
1. **Smart Bear Detection:** Automatically detects if Bear is running
2. **API-First Approach:** Uses Bear API when Bear is running, database when closed
3. **Hashtag Embedding:** Embeds hashtags directly in note content (`#tag`)
4. **Tag Sanitization:** Removes hyphens (Bear doesn't support them)
5. **Proper Formatting:** Uses Bear's exact content format

#### 📦 **New MCP Tools Added:**
- **`trigger_hashtag_parsing`** - Fix individual notes
- **`batch_trigger_hashtag_parsing`** - Fix multiple notes at once
- **Total Tools:** 32 (up from 30)

#### 🎯 **Fallback System:**
1. **Primary:** x-callback-url API with `edit=yes`
2. **Secondary:** Database content simulation
3. **Tertiary:** AppleScript keystroke simulation

#### 🏆 **Success Metrics:**
- ✅ **Hashtags appear in sidebar immediately**
- ✅ **No manual editing required**
- ✅ **Works with Bear running**
- ✅ **Zero database conflicts**
- ✅ **Proper tag hierarchy support**

**🎯 Status:** This breakthrough solves the core hashtag parsing issue! The MCP server now provides a complete, production-ready solution for Bear automation.
